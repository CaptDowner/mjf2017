<h3>The Suffers</h3>

<p>The Suffers are here to shake up the notion that they’re another soul revival band. Just as much influenced by classic rock & roll, country, Latin and Southern hip hop as they are the Stax/Volt or Muscle Shoals era, The Suffers are bringing a fresh approach to what they have coined Gulf Coast Soul. When late night legend David Letterman proclaimed in early 2015 "If you can’t do this, get out of the business," let it be known that The Suffers are here to stay! With a year that included performances for NPR’s Tiny Desk, Newport Folk Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival and The Late Show, The Suffers have delivered over 150 stirring performances of their signature 3rd Coast Soul sound to thousands of new and old fans alike. The large ensemble packs each position of the rhythm and horn section with a level of talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin's massive voice. The band's sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. Their self-titled debut album hit shelves on February 12, 2016, and will be the continuation of what 2015's Make Some Room EP started. Expect to see the band’s name continue to climb up the tier on posters of the best festivals around!</p>
<p>Established in 2011, The Suffers’ lineup was curated by bassist Adam Castaneda and vocalist/keyboardist Pat Kelly, who brought on trumpet player Jon Durbin, trombonist Michael Razo, guitarist Kevin Bernier, percussionist Jose “Chapy” Luna, and drummer/vocalist Nick Zamora. Jazz saxophonist Cory Wilson and guitarist/vocalist Alex Zamora filled out the rhythm section, while frontwoman Kam Franklin topped off the group with soaring vocals.</p>
<p>In a short time, the band has progressed from packing Houston venues to accepting invitations for featured performances at Hangout Music Festival, Pemberton Music Festival, Austin City Limits, Newport Folk Festival, Landmark Music Festival, Voodoo Music + Arts Experience, LouFest, AmericanaFest, UTOPiAfest, SXSW, Free Press Summer Festival, Untapped Festival, CMJ Music Marathon, and more. The Suffers have joined the ranks of Red Bull Sound Select and have remained a local favorite, accepting 20 Houston Press Music Awards in the last three years.</p>
