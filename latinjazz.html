<p>The Latin Jazz Collective - is a seven piece high energy Latin Jazz ensemble led by percussionist John Nava and drummer Martin Binder. Founded by their close partnership and common vision in 2010, their goal is to perform a wide variety of Afro Caribbean music with passion, precision, and musical authenticity. Creating a rich emergence of original and established contemporary Jazz compositions with traditional and modern Latin rhythms as the prime driving musical force, LJC performs in front of audiences far and wide in a variety of settings including public and private concert venues, nightclubs, and festivals. With over fifty years of combined musical experience in the studio, on stage, and in the classroom, the members of LJC maintain active performance schedules as band leaders, arrangers, and music educators throughout the Central California Coast and Bay Areas.</p>
<p>LJC members have shared the stage, recorded, and taught with the likes of Jorge Santana, Malo, Kim Stone (Rippingtons), Webber Iago, Jayson Fann (Ashe Ensemble), Joseph Lucido, Wayne Wallace, and many other respected artists around the world. </p>
