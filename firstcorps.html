<p>Boosting Morale, Education and Community Support through Jazz and Groove</p>
<p>The heart of a Warrior with the soul of a poet, the 5-Man Trio is anything but ordinary. Its members have brought a wealth of combat experience from the deserts of Iraq to the cold mountains of Afghanistan. Their music has sustained them through the lonely nights in Kuwait and hard rains in Korea. And with fate, chance and a little luck they have all come together in the great Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>As part of America’s First Corp Band stationed at Joint Base Lewis McChord, Washington, the 5-Man Trio is entrenched in the community. Their active performance schedule supports military and government functions as well as educational outreach from pre-K through college. The 5-Man Trio is a regular performer at the Vancouver Wine and Jazz Festival, Portland’s Rose Festival and has been featured live on KNKX radio – Seattle’s public jazz and NPR station.</p>
<p>The 5-Man Trio draws heavily from jazz, R&B and funk. Their music has been described as “…smartly-arranged pop jazz covers and cool original tune(s)…” – KNKX online. With a strong melodic sensibility rooted in pop hits they explore new sonic textures and odd meters while never sacrificing the groove. They have also been called “The Best Band in the World.” – Ariana (age 8), Lyons Elementary School, Tacoma, Washington.</p>
<p>When they are not training or performing together the 5-Man Trio enjoy exploring the Pacific Northwest with friends and family.</p>
