<p>So Akili Bradley and Isaac de Vera reply succinctly when asked how it feels to belong to a select group of local students chosen for the Next Generation Jazz Orchestra of the Monterey Jazz Festival.</p>
<p>“It’s a dream come true,” De Vera, 17, said. “I’m really excited to be chosen for this band and to be touring Japan.”</p>
<p>“I’m excited,” said Bradley, 17. “It’s really amazing to be able to go to Japan.”</p>
<p>Bradley, a trumpter, and De Vera, a guitarist, are the only two students from Monterey County in the highly competitive 21-member band — the first time since 2005 that the ensemble has had any local students.</p>
<p>“From 1971 to 2016, just under 8 percent of (band) members have come from Monterey County (about 70 of 905 total),” spokesman Tim Orr said in an email. “The last time a ‘local’ was selected was in 2015 (bassist Kanoa Mendenhall) although she was not a resident in the county at the time. From 2000-2016, there were 17 Monterey County members of the orchestra, the most recent being Bryce Hall in 2004 and Chris Myrick in 2005.”</p>
<p>And now, there’s De Vera and Bradley, who will perform Friday at the Folktale Winery in Carmel before leaving for Japan on a two-week tour. They’ll also perform during the Monterey Jazz Festival in September.</p>
<p>The 21 high school musicians hail from all over the country and there’s even one from Israel. Over the past few weeks they’ve become a tight group, Bradley said, but she’s become especially close with the only other girl in the group.</p>
<p>“The vocalist and I quickly developed a bond, we have so much in common,” she said. “Boys can be rascals sometimes, and I’m more a laid-back person.”</p>
<p>The rascally boys were tossing water bottles as if they were balls during a break in practice on Thursday. But as soon as they returned to the studio, they were all business.</p>
<p>“They’re all just great musicians,” said education director Paul Contos.</p>
<p>Bradley, who grew up in Berkeley and Seaside, recently graduated from the California Virtual Academy, an online charter school. She began playing the trumpet in the fourth grade after being introduced to the recorder in second grade. She’s participated in the SFJAZZ High School All Stars Orchestra and Combo, the Monterey Jazz Festival Monterey County High School All-Star Big Band and other groups. Before being able to join the Next Generation band, she auditioned three other times.</p>
<p>She’ll be studying music at CSU Monterey Bay this fall and plans to continue with a musical career as far as it takes her.</p>
<p>“I love performing so I’d really like to do that, but I like the business side of the industry,” she said. “I would like to be able to do both.”</p>
<p>The son of musician, De Vera has been playing guitar since he was in the sixth grade, although he began with the piano and the trumpet earlier than that. He recently graduated from Monterey High School and has been a member of the Pacific Grove Jazz Club and Monterey Jazz Festival County All-Star Band, among others. He’s heading to UCLA in the fall where he, too, will study music.</p>
<p>“I’d like to be a professional musician but perform in different” areas, he said. “Teaching, performing and be an author.”</p>
<p>But first, he’s heading to Japan.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty unbelievable to me,” he said. “I’m still stunned I got chosen.”</p>
