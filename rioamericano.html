<p>Rio Americano High School, colloquially known as Rio, is a public high school in Sacramento, California, serving students in grades 9 through 12 as part of the San Juan Unified School District. Rio Americano students come from the surrounding areas of Arden Park, Arden Oaks, Sierra Oaks, Fair Oaks, Carmichael, Gold River, and to a much lesser extent, the La Sierra community. In recent years, more students have been transferring from other districts and areas, partly due to the shift of Sacramento High School to a charter school. Rio's two rival schools are Jesuit High School and El Camino Fundamental High School because of its close proximity to the Arden Park area.</p>
<p>As of the 2012-13 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,603 students and 66.01 classroom teachers (on a FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 24.28.[1][2] Brian T. Ginter is the principal. Greg Snyder and Robert Kerr are the vice principals.</p>
<p>Third Place (Tie) at the 2017 Next Generation Jazz Festival High School Big Band Division</p>
<p>The AM Jazz Ensemble, directed by Josh Murray, is part of a 70-student jazz program at Rio Americano High School, a local public school in Sacramento, California. Rio has three full and separate jazz ensembles, of which AM is the highest level. AM has been selected as a finalist for the Essentially Ellington Competition eight times, and has won the Monterey Jazz Festival’s High School competition seven times. The group has performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival well over a dozen times, and has toured and performed in Japan, China, Australia, Argentina, Spain and Italy. AM will be touring Ireland during the summer of 2018. They were selected to open for Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra during their 2017 West Coast tour. AM was selected as a co-winner of DownBeat Magazine’s 2017 Student Music Award for best large jazz group. The members of the group are honored to perform at this year’s Monterey Jazz Festival.</p>
