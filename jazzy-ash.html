<p>Jazzy Ash makes rootsy music for all ages. Her latest album, Swing Set, is arranged and enhanced for a new generation with 14 classic songs, rhythms, and rhymes representing and celebrating a tradition handed down by African-American children, adults, and musicians from the mid-19th century to the early jazz era. </p>
<p>After months of deep research, Jazzy Ash gathered up these time-tested tunes, polishes them up, and presents them to new audience  The songs on Swing Set are interspersed with percussive playground rhymes. Each track is at least 90 years old. Produced by Chris Schlarb at his completely analog studio, these tracks vary from sassy clapping playground rhymes, to soulful lullabies and classic New Orleans melodies, all presented in style by Jazzy Ash and her band with children’s voices sprinkled in to invite listener engagement. Swing Set also features Washington DC-based artist Uncle Devin on “Hambone,” and Sarah Reich (Postmodern Jukebox) on “Ballin’ the Jack.” </p>
<p>“It’s not often we celebrate the work of women, but these songs and games were largely carried along by little girls on the playground. I wanted to convey the grit and soul of that grassroots heritage with this recording,” says Jazzy Ash.
