He will next be seen this summer in Bleecker Street’s Megan Leavey alongside Kate Mara, Tom Felton, Bradley Whitford and Edie Falco.

Common also executive-produced Netflix’s upcoming drama Burning Sands and performs the closing credits original song “The Cross” featuring Lianne Le Havas. The film premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and is slated for a March 10 global release on Netflix.</p>
