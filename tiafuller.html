<p>As a devoted educator, Tia is a full-time Professor at Berklee College of Music, where she directs the prestigious Rainbow Big Band and Rainbow All-Stars, in addition to 6 other ensembles including repertoire and jazz improvisation classes. It is here and beyond, that she believes her passion for teaching and inspiring students is due to her parents being educators/administrators in the Denver Public School District. In addition, she presents lectures, residencies and masterclasses at some of the most respected institutions in the country including Duke University, University of Colorado at Denver, Spelman College, University of Idaho’s Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival, New Mexico State University, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, China Residency, and Rimon School of Music in Israel. Tia was also part of a two-day seminar led by Geri Allen at University of Pittsburgh that included Curtis Fuller, Joe Lovano, Terri Lyne Carrington, and Esperanza Spalding. </p>
<p>Tia moved to Jersey City, New Jersey two days before the events of September 11, 2001. Despite the fact that the jazz community believed there was not much work in the area during that period, she wasn’t discouraged and used the tragic event as a reason to succeed. She got her first gig playing in a big band at a fish fry in South Jersey. Brad Leali, who was playing in the Count Basie Orchestra at the time, spread the word that Tia was a skillful saxophonist who also played the flute. This brought her to the attention of others in the jazz community, including Gerald Wilson, Jimmy Heath, Don Braden and Don Byron, which led to her performing with a number of luminaries in the world of jazz.</p>
<p>With music in her blood and a song in her heart, Tia was born in Aurora, Colorado to jazz musicians, Fred and Elthopia Fuller. Her father, Fred plays bass and her mother, Elthopia sings. She grew up listening to her parents rehearse in the basement of their home, as well as the music of jazz greats, such as John Coltrane, Sarah Vaughan and Charlie Parker.</p>
<p>Inspired by her older sister, Shamie, Tia began playing classical piano when she was just three years old and continued until she was thirteen. She also began studying the flute when she was nine. Her interest in jazz came into fruition in high school. It was during this time that she began playing the saxophone. The Colorado native, and 14-year New Jersey resident who now resides in Boston, says playing music makes her feel as if she is a vessel for the Spirit to flow through. While listening to her songs, she wants people to be uplifted and experience a sense of restoration, compelling them to move forward not in fear, but in love and faith.</p>
