<h3>Sean Jones Quartet</h3>

<p>Several years ago at the Detroit Jazz Festival, I first experienced trumpeter, Sean Jones. I left the Festival convinced that he was heading for big things as a solo artist. Both as a leader, and as a sideman on several stages at the Festival, and at jam sessions late at night, Sean simply lit up the stage in Detroit. He was a firebrand with blistering power on burners, yet with a tender warm, open tone on ballads. His presence was strongly felt.</p>
<p>Jones has now released his eighth album for the Detroit label, Mack Avenue. Sean brings his energy to a live audience at St. Louis’ jazz club, The Bistro. Backed by his long tenured quintet, Jones was ripe and ready to unleash largely new material on an eager audience.</p>
<p>Opening with “Art’s Variable” Jones’ tone is magisterial, commanding and soaring above the rhythm section. Orrin Evans is a great partner on piano as he is highly percussive in his attack, insistent, yet can be spare on his use of space, knowing that less can be sometimes more. Like Jones, his playing demands attention. Sean steps up to take command at the seven and a half minute mark, and ratchets up the energy to heat up the room.</p>
<p>On “Lost and Found” alto saxist, Brian Hogans, blends nicely with Jones. This mid range burner hits the sweet spot. “The Ungentrified Blues” goes from gritty to downright incendiary, taking its time to whip up the audience into a frenzy with held notes and escalating tension.</p>
<p>“BJ’s Tune” was written for Jones’ nephew, the son of Sean’s brother, a minister. It blends gospel and jazz with R & B influences. It begins tenderly but progresses to a soaring conclusion bringing in “Amazing Grace.” From the reaction of the enthusiastic attendees at The Bistro, it is easy to see that Sean has an even brighter future in the top rank of trumpeters on the scene. This live session is a great place to hear his trumpet prowess.</p>
<br/>
<p>Music and spirituality have always been fully intertwined in the artistic vision of trumpeter, composer, educator and activist Sean Jones. Singing and performing as a child with the church choir in his hometown of Warren, Ohio, Sean switched from the drums to the trumpet upon his first exposure to Miles Davis at the age of 10. Twenty-five years later, he still cites Miles’ overall artistic vision and purity of sound as his greatest personal influence. But it was another immortal visionary who had a most profound impact when Sean was a 19-year old student at Youngstown State University – the magnificent John Coltrane through his masterpiece, A Love Supreme – “All at once, everything just came together for me. My past, my present, my future. I knew the course I needed to pursue.” Already exhibiting a superb control of the instrument through his private studies with master trumpeter and educator Esotto Pellegrini and his intensive listening to his other primary influences, Woody Shaw Freddie Hubbard and Clifford Brown, the young trumpeter committed himself to artistic excellence the pursuit of transcendence.</p>
<p>Five years later, after receiving his Master’s Degree from Rutgers University, Sean had a 6-month stint with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. This marked the beginning of a relationship with Wynton Marsalis, whose personal work ethic and ability to break barriers had already made a significant impact on the emerging artist. Wynton offered Sean a permanent position as lead trumpeter and Jones remained there until 2010.</p>
<p>A highly respected and in-demand musician even while at Rutgers, Sean was prominently featured with a number of artists, recording and/or performing with many major figures, including Illinois Jacquet, Jimmy Heath, Frank Foster, Nancy Wilson, Dianne Reeves, Gerald Wilson and Marcus Miller. The relationship with Miller led to another highly impacting experience when Sean was selected by Miller, Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter for their Tribute to Miles tour in 2011. </p>
