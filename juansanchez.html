<p>Juan L. Sanchez turned 50 in December and was feted by his family and friends at a private home in Carmel Valley. Among the sixty or so who serenaded him were his family and fellow musicians, including longtime friend Paul Contos, well-known jazzman and education director for the Monterey Jazz Festival. There was dancing and mariachi. “I felt like I was in heaven.” Still, Sánchez is a work in progress, a restless soul constantly doing while also becoming.</p>
<p>Singer/songwriter Sánchez was born in Málaga, on the Costa del Sol, into a family of musicians and dancers. At 8, he moved to Madrid where he studied at the Real Conservatorio of music. Then at 17 he decided to quit formal music studies in favor of English philology at Complutense University, also in Madrid. At the time, “I did not know any other studies,” he told me. “I imagined myself a journalist, or a priest, or a translator. But I never had a clear path to a career.” (Philology is the study of language from written sources.) “Doing philology gave me the prospect of traveling, and that enticed me.”</p>
<p>During the following five years he taught himself guitar and traveled extensively throughout Europe, working for two summers in Germany, attending both Friedrich Wilhelm Univeristät in Bonn and the Interuniversity Center in Dubrovnik, Croatia. He also visited Turkey, Morocco, Austria, France and Italy, falling in love with their respective folklore. Upon completion of his Bachelor’s degree, he obtained scholarships to Stetson University in Florida, where he studied musical theater and voice, and UCLA, where he completed his MA in Applied Linguistics.</p>
<p>In 1989 he moved to Monterey, where he worked for seven years as a bilingual elementary school teacher. It is also during that time that he started writing his first original compositions. He assembled Trova Latina, a Latin American folk quartet that performed in coffeehouses, libraries and schools in the area.</p>
<p>In 1997 he founded the Juan L. Sánchez Ensemble with an exceptional and eclectic group of musicians well-versed in jazz, Middle-Eastern and Latin music from around the Monterey Bay region. They released their first album Cosmopolita that year and started touring nationally. In 2004, they launched their second release, Hijos de la Tierra (Children of the Earth), dedicated to all farm workers around the world. (To watch click on the video.)</p>
