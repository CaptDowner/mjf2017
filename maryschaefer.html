<p>Mary grew up on Rogers and Hammerstein, Souza Marches and classical music. She took piano lessons as a child and played an organ in church for 7 years.</p>
<p>She has taken 2 years of Musicianship and Harmony at Hartnell College and received the Boronda Scholarship from Hartnell, enabling her to continue her studies in Italy. In addition to teaching Music Together, she is a Certified Level 1 Orff Instructor. </p>
<p>Her journey as a Music Together instructor started as a nanny. She used what she learned in her children's classes as a parent volunteer. Mary began teaching Music Together in 2001. She has taught Music Together in Carmel, Monterey, Salinas, and San Jose. She also gives private piano lessons and does birthday parties.</p>
<p>She has taken numerous Early Childhood Education classes at Hartnell College and has taught music to various preschools on the Monterey Peninsula, including Oasis Charter School and Harmony Home School. </p>
<p>Mary has been singing with the Monterey Peninsula Choral Society, now Monterey Peninsula Voices, for the past 3 years. She got to sing with them in London at the 2012 Olympics and recently toured Italy singing this summer. Working with Dr. Sean Boulware and this wonderful choir has enriched her life immensely and improved her voice.</p>
<p>Mary's passions are children, music and dancing. She feels incredibly blessed to be able to have an abundance of all three in her life. She believes that music is incredibly beneficial in our lives. It can be healing, invigorating and inspirational. Her musical preferences are classic rock, classical and musicals. She loves dancing, preferably to rock or blues or contra music. She feels especially blessed that both her children, now grown, enjoy music, singing and dancing also.</p>
