<p>For the past ten years, the dynamic music duo known as Amendola vs. Blades have been conjuring various sonic deities of swingin’ old-school jazz, funk, and rock, African, improvisational and free-form music to thousands of fans who’ve steadily shown up for one of their highly spontaneous and lively musical adventures. Sure, you may seen and/or heard these two in-demand session players as bandleaders in their own right, or as distinguished sidemen with the likes of Nels Cline (Wilco), Charlie Hunter, John Zorn, Mike Patton, John Scofield, Idris Muhammad, Bernard Purdie of the legendary B3 player Dr. Lonnie Smith, but for longtime drummer Scott Amendola and organist Wil Blades, the dynamic range of Amendola vs. Blades is where things really open up and take off. On their latest live release Greatest Hits, improvisation creatively steers this inventive drum and organ duo through a scenic tour of music genres as each artist pushes and pulls the other toward unanticipated discovery. Through firmly grounded in the groove, they maintain a fun and loose approach that keeps the sonic possibilities endless, and their audiences – as well as themselves – continually engaged and excited to discover what musical boundary is waiting to be explored next.</p>
